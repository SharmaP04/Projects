we analyse US gun murders data collected by FBI

download-data.R - downloads csv file to data directory and creates "murders.csv" object

analysis.R- generates a plot and saves it to figs directory.We use ggsave() to save ggplot object into figs folder of our directory.

wrangle-data.R-  created a derived dataset by reading "murders.csv" file from "data" folder  and saves the updated R object in rda folder

As we have checked our present working directory by getwd() and got this as result.
"/Users/Runjhun/Desktop/R probability/GitHub/Projects/Projects/murders" 

Henceforth, we are using relative path in all our code like {read.csv("data/murders.csv")}
because our all 3 folders (rda,data,figs) reside in the same directory.
